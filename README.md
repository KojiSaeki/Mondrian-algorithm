# Mondrian-algorithm
An implementation of the Mondrian algorithm for data anonymization in c++.
The code implements the Mondrian algorithm for multidimensional k-anonymity as it is described in the paper by LeFevre et al.
The main goal of the algorithm is  that each record has to appear at least k-times in our
data so that its anonymity be assured.
