# Mondrian-algorithm
An implementation of the Mondrian algorithm for data anonymization in c++.
The code implements the Mondrian algorithm for k-anonymity as it is described here:
The main goal of the algorithm is  that each record has to appear at least k-times in our
data so that its anonymity to be assured.
